# giphy-api-app

This is the my first attempt at using working with api's and ajax requests, then working with the object that is returned. 
Basic topics are presented in dynamically created buttons. The user can add topics using the submit button, which then adds another button for that topic, then loading gifs using the search api of giphy.com.
